What's this?
============

SkyBlock Challenge Manager is a small webservice built around
[http://flask.pocoo.org/](Flask) that tracks which challenges on
[http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/600254-surv-skyblock/](SkyBlock) you've
completed.
Currently, the file `challenges.txt' represents the challenges of SkyBlock v2.1.
You can easily update the challenge set by updating the file `challenges.txt'
with the new set of challenges (one challenge per line, see `challenges.txt' for
the exact format).

How to use
==========

You can either run SkyBlock Challenge Manager locally (assuming you've got
Linux) by running skyblock.py in a terminal. Or you can run SkyBlock Challenge
Manager as a WSGI script (you can use the provided skyblock.wsgi if you want).
